This vulnerability could allow valid users to retrieve or write to any file on the device's file system, including the device's saved configuration and Cisco IOS image files, even if the CLI view attached to the user does not allow it. This configuration file may include passwords or other sensitive information. The Cisco IOS SCP server is an optional service that is disabled by default. CLI views are a fundamental component of the Cisco IOS Role-Based CLI Access feature, which is also disabled by default. Devices that are not specifically configured to enable the Cisco IOS SCP server, or that are configured to use it but do not use role-based CLI access, are not affected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability does not apply to the Cisco IOS SCP client feature. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds available for this vulnerability apart from disabling either the SCP server or the CLI view feature if these services are not required by administrators.

Vulnerability is being determined strictly by matching OS Version & Image name.", "bulletinSummary": "Multiple Cisco products are affected by denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities that manipulate the state of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections. By manipulating the state of a TCP connection, an attacker could force the TCP connection to remain in a long-lived state, possibly indefinitely. If enough TCP connections are forced into a long-lived or indefinite state, resources on a system under attack may be consumed, preventing new TCP connections from being accepted. In some cases, a system reboot may be necessary to recover normal system operation. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be able to complete a TCP three-way handshake with a vulnerable system. In addition to these vulnerabilities, Cisco Nexus 5000 devices contain a TCP DoS vulnerability that may result in a system crash.
